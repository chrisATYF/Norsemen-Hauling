        <h3 class="title">Meet the Shield-maidens</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
                Wanda and Brook, a formidable mother and daughter duo, exemplify an unwavering commitment and
                remarkable diligence in their roles. Although they operate primarily behind the scenes, their
                contributions and achievements transcend expectations. These remarkable individuals embody the
                spirit of Shield-maidens, renowned for their unwavering dedication and indomitable strength in their
                field. As adept soldiers in the Viking tradition, they faithfully serve as loyal disciples of
                Christ, epitomizing qualities of loyalty and devotion.

        <h3 class="title">Meet the viking's son</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
                In Proverbs 22:6, it says, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will
                not depart from it." At Norsemen, we believe in teaching the next generation the importance of hard
                work because God holds us to higher standards. As the son of the Viking, Noah is learning
                the invaluable teachings of the virtues of setting a positive precedent, practicing humility,
                and prioritizing service to others over self-interest.
